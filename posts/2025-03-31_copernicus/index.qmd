[Copernicus](https://marine.copernicus.eu/) serves a wide variety of data products through its [maribe data store](https://data.marine.copernicus.eu/products).  We have been wanting to leverage the modeled products such as [Global Ocean Physics Analysis and Forecast](https://data.marine.copernicus.eu/product/GLOBAL_ANALYSISFORECAST_PHY_001_024/description) because it is high resolution, gapless and provides forecasts out to 10 days.  It has a companion [Global Ocean Physics Reanalysis](https://data.marine.copernicus.eu/product/GLOBAL_MULTIYEAR_PHY_001_030/description) which carries the same spatial extent and resolution, but goes back to 1993. This solves, for daily and weekly forecast, the difficulty of, well, forecasting!  Until now the best we could achieve in an operational sense has been nowcasting.  


# Forecasts

We currently store daily forecasts going back to 2022-06-01 (and of course going 9 days ahead of today) for the Northwest Atlantic ("nwa") region. These are updated daily with new forecasts overwriting existing ones - this assumes that the closer we are to a "nowcast" the better the quality of the forecast.

Here's an example of sea surface height ("zos").

# Reanalyses

Reanalyses stretch back to 1993-01-01 but currently only extend to 2021-06-30.  With the advent of the relatively new [copernicusmarine toolbox](https://help.marine.copernicus.eu/en/collections/9080063-copernicus-marine-toolbox) it seems that some of the datasets are still being uploaded to the server. All we can do is wait... but in the meantime we have some 10k+ images covering the same extent and resolution as the forecasts going back to 1993.

# Next

Next for us is to add some chemistry and biology to complement the physical parameters above.
